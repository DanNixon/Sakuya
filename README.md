[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DanNixon/Sakuya.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/DanNixon/Sakuya)

A development assistant that connects with build servers and a ticketing system in the form of a TiLDA MKe, with added Touhou awesomeness.

Can also be used without the TiLDA as a norification system.
